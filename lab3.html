      <h2>Computer Programming</h2>
      <p>Computer programming, often referred to as coding, is the process of designing, writing, testing, and maintaining instructions for a computer to perform specific tasks. These instructions are written in various programming languages such as <mark>C++, Python, and Java</mark>. Programming is at the core of computer science and is used to develop software, websites, and applications.</p>
      <p>Programmers use algorithms to solve problems and develop logical, step-by-step instructions for computers to follow. This creative and problem-solving aspect is what makes programming an exciting field in computer science.</p>

    <section id="two">
      <h2>Data Structures and Algorithms</h2>
      <p><strong>Warning!</strong> Optimal data structures and algorithms are crucial for efficient problem-solving in computer science. <em>Well-designed data structures and efficient algorithms</em> are used to manage and process vast amounts of data. They are fundamental in areas like sorting, searching, and optimizing code performance.</p>
      <p>Data structures include arrays, linked lists, and trees, which help organize and store data. Algorithms, on the other hand, are sets of instructions for performing specific tasks efficiently, such as searching for information in a database or sorting a list of items.</p>

        <h2>Famous Quote</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <q>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.</q>
          <cite> - Arthur C. Clarke</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This thought-provoking quote by Arthur C. Clarke highlights the awe-inspiring nature of advanced technology. In computer science, we often witness the transformation of complex algorithms and code into seemingly magical solutions that enhance our lives and push the boundaries of what's possible.</p>

      <h2>Hello World</h2>
      <pre>
        <code>
          #include < iostream >
          using namespace std;

          int main() {
            cout << "Hello, World!";
            return 0;
          }
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>The "Hello, World!" program is a traditional starting point for many programmers. It's a simple example that demonstrates the basic structure of a program. Learning how to write this program is often the first step for those beginning their journey into the world of computer science.</p>
