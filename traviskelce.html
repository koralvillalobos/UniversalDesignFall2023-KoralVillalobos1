        <p>Considered a two-star recruit by Rivals.com, Kelce accepted a scholarship offer from the University of Cincinnati over offers from Akron, Eastern Michigan, and Miami (OH).[14] He joined his brother, Jason Kelce, who was the starting left guard for the Bearcats.

        <p>Kelce was drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs in the third round (63rd pick overall) of the 2013 NFL Draft. The Chiefs had hired Andy Reid as their new head coach during the off-season. Reid was familiar with Kelce after he had drafted and coached his brother, Jason Kelce, in 2011 during his time as the head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles.</p>

        <h3 id = "2013">2013 Season</h3>
        <p>On June 6, 2013, the Chiefs signed Kelce to a four-year, $3.12 million rookie contract that also included a signing bonus of $703,304. Kelce would injure his knee in the preseason. The injury was later diagnosed as a bone bruise. After being limited the first two weeks of the season due to the injury and being inactive the next 3 games, Kelce was placed on injured reserve on October 12, 2013, after having a microfracture surgery performed on his knee.[28] He only played one snap on special teams in the Chiefs' Week 2 game against the Dallas Cowboys.</p>

        <h3 id = "2014">2014 Season</h3>
        <p>During Week 3 against the Miami Dolphins, Kelce recorded his first NFL touchdown on a 20-yard reception from quarterback Alex Smith. On November 30, he was fined $11,025 for "unsportsmanlike conduct" during a 29–16 loss to the Denver Broncos. Kelce made an inappropriate hand gesture and motion at the Broncos linebacker Von Miller. Chiefs head coach Andy Reid later called this "immature". In the next game against the Arizona Cardinals, Kelce had seven receptions for 110 yards for his first NFL game with over 100 receiving yards. In the regular-season finale against the San Diego Chargers, he had an offensive fumble recovery for a touchdown in the 19–7 victory. Kelce was the Chiefs' leading receiver during the 2014 season, totaling 862 yards off 67 receptions.</p>

In the next game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, he was ejected after receiving two unsportsmanlike conduct penalties after arguing with two officials over not having a pass interference penalty called. The second resulted from him sarcastically throwing his towel at field judge Mike Weatherford in a flagging motion due to being upset about the first penalty. He was later fined $24,309 for his outburst. During Week 13 against the Atlanta Falcons, he had eight receptions for 140 yards. In the next game, Kelce recorded 101 receiving yards against the Oakland Raiders, his fourth consecutive game topping 100.

        <h3 id="2018">2018 Season</h3>
        <p>In the 2018 season, Kelce benefited from the rise of new quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who had an MVP season.[72] After being held to a lone reception for six yards in the season opener against the Los Angeles Chargers, he rebounded with seven receptions for 106 yards and two touchdowns in a Week 2 road victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers.[73] In two of the next three games, he was able to reach 100 receiving yards against the San Francisco 49ers and the Jacksonville Jaguars.[74][75] He added 99 yards and two touchdowns in a Week 9 win over the Cleveland Browns, and went into the Week 12 bye with 10 receptions for 127 yards and a touchdown in an offensively spectacular 54–51 loss to the Los Angeles Rams. In the Week 13 win over the Oakland Raiders, Kelce had career-bests of 12 receptions and 168 yards, including two short touchdowns in the first half.[76] At this point, he was well on his way to an NFL record, but his production tapered off; over the final four weeks, Kelce averaged six receptions for 63.5 yards and had only one touchdown reception.[36] In Week 17, Kelce indeed broke the NFL record for most receiving yards by a tight end in a single season, but 49ers tight end George Kittle passed him to claim the record less than an hour later.[77] Kelce ended the regular season at 10th in the NFL in receptions with 103 and receiving yards with 1,336, and sixth in receiving touchdowns with 10.[78] He was named to the 2018 Pro Bowl and was named first-team All-Pro.[79]</p>
        <p>The Chiefs finished atop the AFC West with a 12–4 record and earned a first-round bye.[80] In the Divisional Round against the Indianapolis Colts, he had seven receptions for 108 yards in the 31–13 victory.[81] In the AFC Championship against the New England Patriots, he had three receptions for 23 yards and a receiving touchdown in the 37–31 overtime loss.[82] He was ranked 21st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2018.</p>

        <p>During Week 2 against the Oakland Raiders, Kelce caught seven passes for 107 yards and a touchdown of the season as the Chiefs won by a score of 28–10.[84] Despite injuries to quarterback Patrick Mahomes and just two touchdowns, at the midpoint of the season Kelce led all tight ends and Chiefs players in receiving yards with 604.[85][86] During Week 11 against the Los Angeles Chargers on Monday Night Football in Mexico, Kelce caught seven passes for 92 yards and a touchdown in the 24–17 win.[87] During Week 14 against the New England Patriots, Kelce caught seven passes for 66 yards and rushed the ball once for a one-yard touchdown during the 23–16 road victory.[88] In the next game against the Denver Broncos, Kelce finished with 11 catches for 142 receiving yards as the Chiefs won 23–3.[89] In the next game against the Chicago Bears on Sunday Night Football, he caught eight passes for 74 yards and a touchdown in the 26–3 win.

        <p>In the Divisional Round against the Houston Texans, the Chiefs began the game with a 24–0 deficit. The Chiefs would then go on a 51–7 run, including 41 unanswered points, to win 51–31. After a drop on third down on the Chiefs first drive that would have been a first down if it had been caught, Kelce caught 10 passes for 134 yards and three touchdowns (all in the second quarter) as he helped lead the Chiefs to their second consecutive conference championship game.[94] In the AFC Championship Game against the Tennessee Titans, Kelce caught three passes for 30 yards during the 35–24 win.[95] In Super Bowl LIV against the San Francisco 49ers, Kelce caught six passes for 43 receiving yards and a receiving touchdown and had one carry for two rushing yards during the 31–20 win.[96] He was ranked 18th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2020.</p>

        <h3 id = "2020">2020 Season</h3>
        <p>Following the release of long-time Chiefs punter Dustin Colquitt in the offseason, Kelce became tied with Anthony Sherman and fellow 2013 draftee Eric Fisher as the longest tenured members of the Chiefs.[98] On August 14, 2020, Kelce signed a four-year, $57 million contract extension with the Chiefs through the 2025 season.[99] In Week 6, against the Buffalo Bills, he recorded two receiving touchdowns in the 26–17 victory.[100] In Week 8 against the New York Jets, Kelce dunked the ball through the goal posts after scoring a touchdown, paying homage to former Chiefs tight end Tony Gonzalez. He was penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct and was fined $12,500.[101] In Week 9, against the Carolina Panthers, he had ten receptions for 159 receiving yards in the 33–31 victory.</p>
        <p>In Week 11 against the Las Vegas Raiders on Sunday Night Football, Kelce recorded eight catches for 127 yards including the game-winning touchdown during the 35–31 win.[103] In Week 13 against the Denver Broncos on Sunday Night Football, Kelce recorded eight catches for 136 yards and a touchdown during the 22–16 win.[104] In the following game, he posted an identical statistical performance of eight catches for 136 yards and a touchdown against the Miami Dolphins in a 33–27 victory.[105] In Week 16, Kelce became the first tight end to have two 100-catch seasons.[3][2] Kelce caught seven passes, giving him a career-high 105 for the season. Kelce set the single-season yardage record for a tight end with 1,416, topping the 1,377 yards posted by George Kittle in 2018.[3][2][106] His yardage ranked second overall in the 2020 NFL season (behind Stefon Diggs' 1,535), while his total receptions ranked fifth in the NFL and second among tight ends (behind Darren Waller's 107).[107] He was named to his sixth Pro Bowl and earned First-team All-Pro honors.</p>
        <p>In the Divisional Round of the playoffs against the Cleveland Browns, Kelce recorded eight catches for 109 yards and a touchdown during the 22–17 win.[110] In the AFC Championship against the Bills, Kelce recorded 13 catches for 118 yards and two touchdowns in a 38–24 win to advance to Super Bowl LV.[111] In the Super Bowl, despite Kelce catching 10 passes for 133 yards which set the record for most receiving yards by a tight end in a single Super Bowl, the Chiefs could not score a touchdown in the 31–9 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.[112][113] He was ranked fifth by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2021.</p>

        <h3 id = "2021">2021 Season</h3>
        <p>Following the release of longtime Chiefs left tackle Eric Fisher and retirement of longtime fullback Anthony Sherman in the offseason, Kelce became the longest-tenured member of the Chiefs.[98] In the Chiefs second game of the season against the Baltimore Ravens, he become the fastest tight end in NFL history to record 8,000 career yards, surpassing Rob Gronkowski's record in 113 games.[115] In the Chiefs week 15 game against the Los Angeles Chargers, he set a career high for receiving yards in a game with 191 yards. He also caught two touchdowns, including the game-winning 34-yard touchdown in overtime.[116] He was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance.[117] The game also put him over 1,000 yards for the season, his NFL record (among tight ends) extending sixth consecutive 1,000-yard season. It also extended his record for most 1,000-yard seasons by a tight end with six. He was placed on the Reserve/COVID-19 list on December 20, 2021.[118] He was activated on December 25, 2021.[119] However, due to NFL protocols for COVID-19, since he tested positive for the virus and did not test negative before the day of the game, he was ruled out for the Chiefs Week 16 game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. It was the first game he'd missed due to injury or illness since his rookie season.[120] In the regular season-ending game against the Denver Broncos, Kelce became the fastest tight end in NFL history to reach 9,000 career yards in just 127 games, a record also previously held by Gronkowski with 140 games.[121] He finished the season with 92 receptions for 1,125 receiving yards and nine touchdowns. He was named Second-Team All-Pro by the AP, his sixth overall All-Pro selection. He was also named to his seventh consecutive Pro Bowl.</p>
        <p>In the Wild Card Round against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Kelce had five receptions for 108 yards and a receiving touchdown to go along with a two-yard touchdown pass to Byron Pringle in the 42–21 victory.[123] In the Divisional Round against the Buffalo Bills, he had eight receptions for 96 yards and the game-winning touchdown in the 42–36 overtime victory.[124] Kelce was wearing an NFL Films microphone for the game, and audio footage from the two offensive plays of the 13-second drive revealed that Kelce instructed Tyreek Hill to run the route which led to the success of the first completion, and revealed him suggesting to Mahomes that he might improvise his own route on the second offensive play if the Bills' defensive scheme didn't change. Prior to the snap, Mahomes realized Kelce's suggested improvised route would work and shouted "Do it, Kelce!", before finding his tight-end for a completion of 25 yards.</p>
        <p>In the AFC Championship against the Cincinnati Bengals, he had 10 receptions for 95 yards and a touchdown in the 27–24 overtime loss.</p>

        <h3 id ="relationships">Relationships</h3>
        <p>Kelce and Maya Benberry, the winner of his dating show, started dating after the show ended in April 2016.[157] In January 2017, Benberry confirmed that they had broken up.</p>
        <p>From 2017 to 2022, Kelce was in a relationship with social media influencer Kayla Nicole.</p>
        <p>During the 2023 NFL season, several media outlets linked Kelce romantically to singer Taylor Swift,[162][163] though this was not directly confirmed by Kelce or Swift.[164] Swift attended the Chiefs game against the Chicago Bears.[163] The alleged relationship between Kelce and Swift had considerable impact on NFL viewership, with the Chiefs–Bears game drawing the most television viewers of the weekend. Kelce's jersey sales increased by 400% and Chiefs home game tickets were also documented.[165] NBC would use the phenomenon to promote the Chiefs' Sunday Night Football game at the New York Jets the following week, producing a promo set to Swift's song "Welcome to New York".[166] The game—which Swift also attended—averaged 27 million viewers, making it the most-watched Sunday-night NFL game to-date since Super Bowl LVII.</p>

The Chiefs responded by making "Fight for Your Right" its touchdown song during games at Arrowhead Stadium.[168][169] Kelce would continue the practice with the Chiefs' second championship in four years, adding a live performance of the song with Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show.</p>

        <h3 id = "lastname">Last Name pronunciation</h3>
        <p>During the 2021 offseason, Kelce said he pronounces his last name /ˈkɛlsi/ KEL-see, because that is the way his father pronounces it, although the rest of his father's side of his family pronounces it /kɛls/ KELSS.[5] Kelce's brother, Jason, later elaborated that their father "at some point ... got tired of correcting everyone calling him 'Kell-see.' ... And now I think we're both at the point where we're riding with Ed 'Kell-see.'"</p>
