                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Koral Villalobos. I'm passionate about coding and am always eager to learn more and improve my skills. In my free time, I enjoy reading, hiking, and exploring the wonders of technology. This class portal will serve as a repository for all my coding assignments and projects throughout this semester.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some fun facts about me are that I am a first generation college student. My last name means Village of Wolves. I was also recruited to play D1 soccer. I will be working for High Noon after college. My favorite book is Atomic Habits by James Clear.

                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                    <li><a href="traviskelce.html">Lab 2 - Coding & Posting a Web Page - The Basics</a></li>
                    <p>
                        In this lab, I learned the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. I was able to create a basic web page layout, and understand how styling can be applied to enhance visual presentation. One of the key takeaways was the importance of keeping code organized and readable.
                    </p>
                    <li><a href="lab3.html">Lab 3 - Tables, Forms, Tabbed Browsing, and Screen Reading</a></li>
                    <p>
                        Lab 3 was an insightful exploration into the world of forms, tables, and accessibility features. I learned how to create user-friendly forms and organize data using tables, ensuring that the content is accessible for screen readers, thus emphasizing the importance of web accessibility.
                    </p>
                    <li><a href="lab4.html">Lab 4 - Accessible CSS Layout</a></li>
                    <p>
                        In this lab, the focus was on creating layouts using CSS. I delved into various CSS properties and learned how to make a responsive design. The lab emphasized the significance of making web pages accessible and visually appealing across different devices.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The final project was a culmination of all the skills learned during the semester. I applied my knowledge in HTML and CSS to create a comprehensive and interactive web application. This project was a significant learning experience, showcasing the practical application of web development concepts.

                    I'm excited to share details about my favorite project, SkiStats, which I completed in my Software Development class. This project was an incredible learning experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this project, we focused on creating a good source for data to help you take the best ski trip. You can casually check out all the different resorts filtered by pass type, state, total runs, ease, and alphabetically. You can also create an account to have the ability to sign in, save your favorite resorts, and create a wishlist for your dream ski trip. Once you have decided on the resort/mountain you wanna visit, you can check out the closest hotels, the weather, and the drive time. This website is a great synopsis for people to easily see and know all the important data on their favorite mountains.
