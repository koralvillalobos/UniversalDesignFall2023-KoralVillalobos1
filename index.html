        Hello! My name is Koral Villalobos. I'm passionate about coding and am always eager to learn more and improve my skills. In my free time, I enjoy reading, hiking, and exploring the wonders of technology. This class portal will serve as a repository for all my coding assignments and projects throughout this semester.
