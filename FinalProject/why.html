    <h2>Goals of Universal Design</h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Universal Design (UD) aims to make products and environments accessible and usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Key goals include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Equitable Use:</strong> The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexibility in Use:</strong> The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Simple and Intuitive Use:</strong> Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level.</li>
            <li><strong>Perceptible Information:</strong> The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user’s sensory abilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Tolerance for Error:</strong> The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions.</li>
            <li><strong>Error Tolerances:</strong> The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions.</li>
