            <h2>What is Universal Design?</h2>
            <p><strong>Universal Design (UD)</strong> is an <em>inclusive design philosophy</em> that aims to create environments, products, and services that are accessible to as many people as possible, regardless of age, disability, or other factors. This approach not only considers the accessibility for individuals with disabilities but also the broad spectrum of human abilities and preferences. The goal is to produce solutions that are <mark>inherently usable by everyone</mark>without the need for adaptation or specialized design.</p>
            <p>Advanced reasoning in UD goes beyond mere compliance with accessibility standards; it involves a <strong>proactive consideration</strong> of <em>diverse user needs</em> throughout the design process. This can include ergonomic design for physical comfort, clear and intuitive user interfaces for cognitive ease, and aesthetic considerations that make products and environments not only functional but also <mark>pleasurable to use</mark>. By embracing these principles, designers and developers can create more inclusive, equitable, and sustainable solutions that benefit a wider range of users.</p>
