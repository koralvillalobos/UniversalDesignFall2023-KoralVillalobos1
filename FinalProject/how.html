                <h2>HTML5 Semantic Structure</h3>
                    <details>
                        <summary>What is Semantic Structure in HTML?</summary>
                        <p>
                            Semantic structure in web development refers to using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) in a way that reinforces the meaning of the content on the web page. It involves choosing the right HTML elements to accurately represent the different parts and roles of your content. This practice not only makes web pages more informative and easier to understand for users but also for search engines and assistive technologies like screen readers.
                        </p>
                    
                        <h3>Importance of Semantic Structure</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Screen readers and other assistive technologies rely on the semantic structure to convey information to users with disabilities. Proper use of elements like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt; helps these users navigate and understand the content more effectively.</li>
                            <li><strong>SEO (Search Engine Optimization):</strong> Search engines use the semantic structure to index the content of web pages. Properly structured content can lead to better search engine rankings.</li>
                            <li><strong>Maintainability:</strong> Semantic HTML makes it easier for developers to understand and maintain the code. It's more straightforward to identify the role of each part of the webpage.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cross-Device Compatibility:</strong> Semantic structure helps ensure that content is displayed correctly across different devices and browsers.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </details>
                    
                <p>Semantic Elements</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>&lt;article&gt;</code>: Represents a self-contained composition in a document that's intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article).</li>
                    <li><code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>:  Used for content that is tangentially related to the content around it, like a sidebar.</li>
                    <li><code>&lt;details&gt;</code>: additional details that can be hidden</li>
                    <li><code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code>: is used for self-contained content, often with a visual aspect (like an image, diagram, or code snippet), with figcaption providing a caption.</li>
                    <li><code>&lt;figure&gt;</code>: is used for self-contained content, often with a visual aspect (like an image, diagram, or code snippet), with figcaption providing a caption.</li>
                    <li><code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>: Represents the footer of a document or section and often contains authorship information, copyright notices, links to privacy policies, etc.t</li>
                    <li><code>&lt;header&gt;</code>: Represents introductory content or a set of navigational links. Typically contains the website's logo, title, and navigation menus.</li>
                    <li><code>&lt;main&gt;</code>: Specifies the main content of a document. It's important for accessibility as it allows screen readers to quickly find the primary content.e</li>
                    <li><code>&lt;mark&gt;</code>: marked or <mark>highlighted</mark> text</li>
                    <li><code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>: Defines a section of navigation links. This element is often used for the main navigation menus.</li>
                    <li><code>&lt;section&gt;</code>: Defines a section in a document. It's a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading.</li>

                    <h2>Skip Navigation for Accessibility</h2>
                    <p>
                        Skip navigation is an important accessibility feature that allows users to quickly bypass repetitive or non-essential content and jump directly to the main content of a web page. This feature is particularly valuable for users who rely on screen readers or keyboard navigation to access web content.
                    </p>
                
                    <h3>Why Skip Navigation?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The main reasons for implementing skip navigation are:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Enhanced Accessibility:</strong> Skip navigation helps users with disabilities, especially those who use screen readers, to avoid lengthy navigation menus, headers, and other content that may be repeated on multiple pages.</li>
                        <li><strong>Efficient Navigation:</strong> It improves the efficiency of navigating web pages, as users can easily jump to the main content without having to listen to or tab through irrelevant content.</li>
                        <li><strong>Compliance with Accessibility Standards:</strong> Many accessibility guidelines and standards, such as WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines), recommend or require the implementation of skip navigation links to improve web accessibility.</li>
                    </ul>
                
                    <h3>Implementing Skip Navigation</h3>
                    <p>
                        To implement skip navigation on your website, follow these steps:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Add a Skip Navigation Link:</strong> Include a visible "Skip to main content" link at the very beginning of your HTML document, typically in the header. This link should be the first focusable element on the page.</li>
                        <li><strong>Provide a Meaningful Label:</strong> Ensure that the skip navigation link has a clear and concise label like "Skip to main content" to convey its purpose to users.</li>
                        <li><strong>Use CSS to Hide by Default:</strong> Initially, hide the skip navigation link from sighted users using CSS techniques like setting the link's position off-screen (e.g., using the `position: absolute; left: -9999px;` technique).</li>
                        <li><strong>Make It Keyboard Accessible:</strong> Ensure that the skip navigation link is keyboard accessible, meaning users can focus and activate it using keyboard navigation (e.g., pressing the "Tab" key).</li>
                        <li><strong>Show on Focus:</strong> Use CSS or JavaScript to make the skip navigation link visible when it receives keyboard focus. This ensures that it's visible to keyboard and screen reader users when they need it.</li>
                    </ol>
                
                    <h3>Testing and Validation</h3>
                    <p>
                        After implementing skip navigation, thoroughly test it to ensure that it functions correctly with various assistive technologies. Use screen readers and keyboard navigation to verify its effectiveness in skipping to the main content.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        By providing skip navigation functionality on your website, you enhance its accessibility, making it more inclusive and user-friendly for individuals with disabilities.
                    </p>
